## 🎮 How It Works
- Guess the mystery cricketer using the search box.
- Attributes unlock only when your guess matches the mystery player.
- Numeric hints show:
  - **↑** if the mystery player's value is higher  
  - **↓** if the mystery player's value is lower  
- You get **7 guesses**, with an optional **bonus 8th guess**.
- After **4 guesses**, you unlock **1 hint** to reveal any one hidden attribute.
- Results can be shared via a premium-style emoji grid.
